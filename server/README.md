  * [ ] Each endpoint should respond with appropriate error codes: 200 for success, 4XX for user error, 5XX for server error.

**For data storage:**
  * [ ] You should store data in memory
  * [ ] Ideally using a well known data structure from your programming language's standard library.

**A "Set" endpoint:**

  * [ ] It should be available at the /set url path
  * [ ] The request should contain a JSON POST body consisting of a JSON entry of the following form: {"key": "<some key>", "value": "<string value>" }.
  * [ ] This endpoint should set the key value pair in memory.
  * [ ] The keys and values should be strings only
  * [ ] If successful, the response should be the JSON object that was just set.

**A "Get" endpoint**
  * [ ] It should use the GET HTTP method
  * [ ] It should be available at the /get url path
  * [ ] The request should be of the form: /get?key=someKey, which should return the value stored in memory for "someKey".
  * [ ] The response body should be a JSON object of the following form: {"key": "<some key>", "value": "<string value>" }.
  * [ ] If called with no parameters, it should return an error.

**A "Delete" endpoint**
  * [ ] It should use the POST HTTP method
  * [ ] It should be available at the /delete url path
